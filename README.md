# War-card-game
War is a card game typically played by two players. The objective of the game is to win all of the cards.

Gameplay:

The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time,
face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places his stack of cards face down,
in front of him.

Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card
takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.

If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up three cards face
down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles
(six cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places
another card face down and turns another card face up. The player with the
higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.
